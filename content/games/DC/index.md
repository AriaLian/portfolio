## Game Overview
Take on the role of a Victorian-era Dungeon CEO. Manage resources, recruit monsters, and customize your deck to dominate turn-based fights. Outwit your opponents, acquire coins, and lead the Dungeon Company to victory in a world teeming with adventures and gods.

As the newly appointed CEO of Dungeon Company, you are forced into a world where gods, adventurers, and strange entities lurk beyond the dungeon's walls. What is your mission? Keep your monster workforce alive, manage resources effectively, and earn as much gold as possible—all while striking a delicate balance between profit and danger.
